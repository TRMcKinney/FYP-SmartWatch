# SmartWatch

My Mechanical Engineering (MEng) Final Year Project (FYP)

The aim of this project is to assess the use of Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRâ€™s) in Human Machine Interfaces as a potential input mechanism to increase interface bandwidths. The project used a Raspberry Pi as the base of a test bed emulating a smartwatch, this was connected to FSR sensors, via an Arduino, to detect force exertions. A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) was programmed to imitate a smartwatch interface with some working functionality including a music player, sensor data information and time/date. The FSR sensor control was assessed with music playback using hand and finger gestures to start or stop the playback.
